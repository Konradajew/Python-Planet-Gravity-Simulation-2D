# Planet Simulation in Python

This is a 2D planetary system simulation in Python using `Tkinter` and `turtle`.  
The project allows interactive observation of celestial bodies, adding custom planets, and visualizing their trajectories and velocity vectors.

## Features

- Newtonian gravity-based simulation of planetary motion.
- Supports 2 to 10 planets by default.
- Add your own planet with mass, position, velocity, and size.
- Draw trajectories and velocity vectors for planets.
- Interactive interface with buttons and keyboard shortcuts:
  - `S` - Start simulation
  - `T` - Draw trajectory
  - `C` - Clear trajectory
  - `W` - Toggle velocity vectors
  - `M` - Return to menu
  - `ESC` - Exit simulation
 
- ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/PlanetSimulationPython.git
